# Easy2Go
This project was developed during 3rd year 2nd semester for Software Engineering Lab project

1. It is a density based traffic controlling system
2. IR sensors are used to measure the traffic density
3. The Sensor will send data to the server using ethernet shield
4. REST API were used to retrieve data from the server using googleâ€™s volley framework
5. The app will show the traffic situation to the user

Components : Arduino UNO R3 , Ethernet Shield 

## ~~As The Google Maps API is not Working due to the changing policy of google __the traffic condition do not works now__~~
